# [routes should update when signals in signalSet change (even if not directly used)](../../route_url_sync.test.js)

```js
try {
  // This test demonstrates signal reactivity between parent and child routes.
  // PREVIOUSLY: The signal reading loop at line 771 was commented out, which could
  // cause routes to not update when signals in their signalSet change.
  // NOW: Signal reading is enabled (line 771 uncommented) and the test shows proper reactivity.
  // 
  // The scenario:
  // 1. Parent route `/admin/:section` uses only sectionSignal
  // 2. Child route `/admin/:section/:page` uses sectionSignal AND pageSignal  
  // 3. Parent's signalSet includes pageSignal due to child relationship (setupPatterns)
  // 4. When pageSignal changes, parent updates because signal reading establishes dependencies
  // 5. Test result: "PASS - Parent updates when child signal changes (signal reading works)"
  
  const sectionSignal = stateSignal("general", { id: "section" });
  const pageSignal = stateSignal("overview", { id: "page" });

  const { PARENT_ROUTE, CHILD_ROUTE } = setupRoutes({
    // Parent route - only uses sectionSignal directly
    PARENT_ROUTE: `/admin/:section=${sectionSignal}`,
    // Child route - uses both signals, creates parent-child relationship
    CHILD_ROUTE: `/admin/:section=${sectionSignal}/:page=${pageSignal}`,
  });

  // Capture initial URLs
  const parentInitial = PARENT_ROUTE.url;
  const childInitial = CHILD_ROUTE.url;

  // Change section signal - both routes should update (normal behavior)
  sectionSignal.value = "advanced";
  const parentAfterSection = PARENT_ROUTE.url;
  const childAfterSection = CHILD_ROUTE.url;

  // Reset section to original
  sectionSignal.value = "general";

  // CRITICAL TEST: Change page signal
  // - Child route should update (uses pageSignal directly)
  // - Parent route should update IF signal reading works (pageSignal in signalSet due to child)
  // - If signal reading is bypassed, parent won't update (reproduces the bug)
  pageSignal.value = "settings";
  
  const parentAfterPage = PARENT_ROUTE.url;
