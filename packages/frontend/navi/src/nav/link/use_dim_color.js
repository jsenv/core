/*
 * Custom hook to apply semi-transparent color when an element should be dimmed.
 *
 * Why we do it this way:
 * 1. **Precise timing**: Captures the element's natural color exactly when transitioning
 *    from normal to dimmed state (not before, not after)
 * 2. **Avoids CSS inheritance issues**: CSS `currentColor` and `color-mix()` don't work
 *    reliably for creating true transparency that matches `opacity: 0.5`
 * 3. **Performance**: Only executes when the dimmed state actually changes, not on every render
 * 4. **Color accuracy**: Uses `color(from ... / 0.5)` syntax to preserve the exact visual
 *    appearance of `opacity: 0.5` but applied only to color
 * 5. **Works with any color**: Handles default blue, visited purple, inherited colors, etc.
 * 6. **Maintains focus outline**: Since we only dim the text color, focus outlines remain
 *    fully visible for accessibility
