/**
 * A popup positioned via `anchor`/`anchorArea`, driven either by
 * --navi-toggle/--navi-open/--navi-close commands or the `open` prop.
 *
 * Two entirely separate rendering strategies exist in this one file, each
 * its own real component: `PopoverViaAttribute` (native Popover API,
 * `popover="manual"`, `showPopover()`/`hidePopover()`, promoted to the top
 * layer) and `PopoverCustom` (a plain `position: absolute` div, genuinely
 * relative to its nearest positioned ancestor — clipped by that ancestor's
 * own `overflow: hidden`/`auto`, unlike the top layer). The exported
 * `Popover` component first picks between an internally-managed open
 * controller (Uncontrolled) and one owned by the caller (Controlled, used
 * by picker_custom.jsx/side_panel.jsx) — kept as its own separate step so
 * `useOpenControllerByProps` (a whole controller instance) is only ever
 * created when actually needed, not unconditionally on every render.
 * `ControlledPopover` then picks which rendering strategy actually mounts,
 * from the `anchor`/`anchorFallback` props alone (no `anchor` given *and*
 * `anchorFallback="auto"` → `PopoverCustom`, everything else →
 * `PopoverViaAttribute`) — by this point an `openController` is always
 * already resolved.
 *
 * Both components share the exact same `usePopoverProps(props)` hook for
 * everything that doesn't genuinely differ between them, once an
 * `openController` is already resolved: focus/debug/id plumbing, capture
 * setup, animation-attribute resolution, the open-commit sequence, the
 * close handler, and — inlined directly in the hook's own `openEffect`,
 * branching on a single `isCustom` flag rather than living in two separate
 * functions — the open/position/close sequence itself. Keeping it inline
 * (instead of splitting into two functions the way an earlier version of
 * this file did) makes the actual, genuine differences between the two
 * renderers easier to see at each point they occur — backdrop show/hide
 * mechanics and anchor-positioning math — rather than having to diff two
 * separately-scrolled functions to find them; everything else in the
 * sequence (capture setup, animation resolution, the commit/close steps)
 * is one shared call either way. `PopoverViaAttribute`/`PopoverCustom`
 * themselves stay two separate, real components (see below) even though
 * their own JSX bodies are trivial and identical today — they're expected
 * to diverge in DOM structure later (e.g. one of them needing an extra
 * wrapper), so collapsing them into one now would just mean re-splitting
 * them apart again once that need arrives.
 *
 * `anchor` (a ref or a DOM element — no other value is accepted anymore; a
 * plain string is a near-certain leftover from an older API and gets a dev
 * warning, then treated the same as omitting it) is the only way to
 * request a real anchor. When it's omitted, `anchorFallback` decides both
 * what to dock against instead *and* which rendering strategy handles it:
 *
 * - `anchorFallback="viewport"` (default) → the via-attribute renderer,
 *   docked to the viewport itself.
 * - `anchorFallback="auto"` → the custom renderer, docked to the popover's
 *   own positioned ancestor instead — respects that ancestor's own
 *   `overflow: hidden`/`auto`, unlike the top layer (see
 *   `getPositioningContainer` in visible_rect.js/offset_parent.js for how
 *   it's found).
 *
 * A real `anchor` always wins over `anchorFallback` regardless of its
 * value — the custom renderer structurally never has a real-anchor case
 * (its popover is `position: absolute` relative to its own ancestor, not
 * the document root — a real anchor's own coordinate math assumes the
 * latter), so `anchorFallback="auto"` together with a real `anchor` would
 * be a contradiction; `anchor` simply takes priority, same as it always
 * did.
 *
 * When there's no `anchor` prop, the triggering event's own carried anchor
 * (`detail.anchor`/`.source`) is used instead, *only* for the via-attribute
 * renderer (the custom renderer never considers it, unconditionally — its
 * own docked positioning can't use a real anchor either way) — unless
 * `anchorCustomEventDetail="ignore"` (default `"override"`), which skips
 * that fallback entirely, forcing the `anchorFallback` docked placement
 * regardless of what triggered the open (used by the demo's "Ignoring the
 * anchor" section).
 *
 * All of this is resolved down to a single value inline in `openEffect`
 * (only one call site, not worth a standalone function): either a real
 * anchor element, or `undefined` — `hasAnchorElement` (just
 * `Boolean(anchor)`) is what the rest of the code branches on from there.
 * ("Real anchor" isn't quite the right word for that boolean either, since
 * a container being docked to is arguably a real anchor in its own right
 * too — `hasAnchorElement` is meant narrowly: is there a specific *element*
 * being positioned against, as opposed to sticking to a container's own
 * rect.)
 *
 * `aria-expanded` lives on the popover element itself, toggled imperatively
 * in sync with showPopover()/hidePopover() (or, for the custom renderer, a
 * plain inline `display` toggle — see the custom branch's own comments
 * below) so popup_css.js can key its CSS off one selector for both Popover
 * and Dialog. Both renderers share the exact same `.navi_popover`/
 * `.navi_popover_backdrop` classes — CSS that differs between them keys off
 * the native popover element's own `[popover]` attribute (present only for
 * the via-attribute renderer) rather than an extra class.
 *
 * `pointerInteractionOutsideEffect` ("none" default / "close" / "capture")
 * is implemented via a backdrop, a sibling element (not a descendant of the
 * real popover — a stacking-context root's own background/border always
 * paints *below* even its own negative-z-index children, so a z-index trick
 * on a *descendant* backdrop could never truly sit behind the real
 * popover's own background). For the via-attribute renderer it's a
 * top-layer sibling (promoted the same way, so it naturally stacks above
 * normal page content without needing z-index); for the custom renderer
 * it's a plain `position: absolute; inset: 0` sibling confined to the
 * *same* positioned ancestor as its popover (not the whole viewport —
 * natural DOM order alone puts it behind the popover content, both being
 * plain positioned siblings with no special stacking involved).
 * It opens/closes together with the real popover, freshly re-shown (hidden
 * first if still open) on every open so its top-layer position resets to
 * just below the real popover — this matters when several via-attribute
 * popovers are open at once, since an older backdrop left in its original
 * top-layer slot would sit above a more-recently-opened popover, and an
 * outside click on that popover would never reach it.
 * Hiding is deferred until the browser's matching "click" fires when the
 * close was triggered by a mousedown (an outside click): hiding it
 * synchronously would make the mousedown's target vanish before mouseup,
 * silently dropping that click (see armSuppressNextOpenRequest in
 * open_controller.js, which depends on that click too) — aria-expanded is
 * still set to "false" immediately, so the backdrop stops intercepting
 * anything right away even while it's still pending. Not rendered at all
 * when the effect is "none" (`backdropProps` is `null` in that case).
 *
 * anchorArea's grammar (loosely inspired by CSS position-area): two
 * space-separated words, order-independent. y: above/aligned-top/center/
 * aligned-bottom/below. x: on-the-left/aligned-left/center/aligned-right/
 * on-the-right. A bare word means no overlap with the anchor; "aligned-"
 * means edges touching. A single word implies "center" on the other axis.
 * The 4 corners (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) are presets
 * for the "aligned-" pair on both axes.
 *
 * When there's no real anchor element (`!hasAnchorElement`, true for the
 * custom renderer always, and for the via-attribute renderer whenever no
 * anchor was resolved), both renderers dock against a container instead —
 * the viewport itself for via-attribute, this popover's own positioned
 * ancestor for the custom renderer — via the *same* `pickPositionRelativeTo`
 * call either way, simply omitting its `anchor` argument (see that
 * function's own doc in visible_rect.js for what its own no-anchor,
 * container-docked mode changes: the "float away with a gap" bare
 * directions collapse to their "aligned-*" equivalent internally, flipping
 * is skipped entirely, and the coordinate space/clamp bounds become the
 * container's own instead of the document's). The via-attribute renderer
 * leaves `container` unspecified — `pickPositionRelativeTo` resolves it to
 * the viewport on its own, since the popover element's own `[popover]`
 * attribute signals that (see `getPositioningContainer`); the custom
 * renderer passes its own positioned ancestor explicitly, already computed
 * above for `visibleRectEffect`'s own observation target.
 *
 * `animation="auto"` resolves to "scaling" for any real anchor, or for a
 * point/corner placed dead-center (an "aligned-"/"center" axis means the
 * popover overlaps the anchor there, so a translate reads oddly — see
 * resolveDirectionValue below); "sliding" otherwise (a point/corner with a
 * direction, no anchor edge to grow out of) — concretely as one of
 * popup_css.js's `slide-from-*` values, computed here in JS (not left for
 * CSS to puzzle out from raw position attributes) so there's a single,
 * inspectable `navi-animation` value driving one direct CSS rule per
 * direction, no attribute-cascade indirection.
 * `animation="expanding"` (grows out of a real anchor's own edge, `expand-*`
 * concretely — via-attribute only, since the custom renderer never has a
 * real anchor) and `animation="fading"` (opacity only, no motion) are both
 * explicit-only — never auto-picked.
 *
 * A genuinely satisfying popup-opening animation is hard to pull off —
 * "scaling" is the kind that reads best in practice, which is why it's the
 * auto-pick for any real anchor. "expanding" (growing out of the anchor's
 * own edge) comes close, but "scaling" still does it better, hence staying
 * explicit-only rather than becoming a second auto-pick.
 *
 * A `spawnFromPointer`-style option (growing from the click/pointer position
 * instead of the anchor/center) was tried and dropped: it's a tempting idea
 * on paper, but in practice it adds motion that competes for attention with
 * the popover's own content, which is what should actually draw the eye
 * once it opens — not where it came from.
 *
 * Each `navi-animation` value's own CSS rule (popup_css.js) includes its
 * own fade in/out — no separate `fadeAnimation` prop or attribute.
 * `resolvedAnimation` is mirrored onto the backdrop's own `navi-animation`
 * too, which only ever fades regardless of which kind it is (see the
 * backdrop's own CSS comment for why).
 *
 * The via-attribute renderer's own `.navi_popover` switches to
 * `position: fixed` whenever the resolved animation is a `slide-from-*`
 * value (`&[popover][navi-animation^="slide-from"]` below) — regardless of
 * whether there's a real anchor or not. The point is avoiding a scrollbar:
 * a `slide-from-*` entrance genuinely translates the box up to 100% of its
 * own size off past one edge for the *closed* frame, which, for a
 * `position: absolute` box, would contribute to the document's scrollable
 * area while that frame is committed (the same "closed" frame this file's
 * open-commit reflow-trick sequence always briefly renders before
 * flipping `aria-expanded`) — `position: fixed` never contributes to
 * document scroll size, sidestepping it. Since `resolvedAnimationKind ===
 * "sliding"` (the only kind that can ever resolve to `slide-from-*` — see
 * `resolveDirectionValue`) is knowable immediately from `parsedAnchorArea`
 * alone, before positioning ever runs, `navi-animation` is given an early,
 * placeholder `slide-from-*` value (any one works — only the attribute's
 * own `slide-from` *prefix* matters for the CSS selector above) right after
 * `resolvedAnimationKind` is known, so `position: fixed` is already in
 * effect by the time the first `pickPositionRelativeTo` call measures
 * scroll offset — getting this order wrong would measure/position the
 * popover as if it were still `absolute`, one frame before the CSS
 * actually made it `fixed`, visibly offsetting it by the page's scroll
 * amount on that first paint. The final resolution step (further down,
 * after positioning) then overwrites that placeholder with the real, final
 * direction — "expanding" is the only other kind resolved that late (it
 * needs `pickPositionRelativeTo`'s own already-resolved
 * `data-position-y/x-current`), but it can never produce a `slide-from-*`
 * value, so its own later timing is never a problem for `position: fixed`.
 *
 * `data-anchor-out-of-view` marks a real anchor that's scrolled out of view
 * (`visibilityRatio <= 0.2`) — never set at all when `!hasAnchorElement`,
 * since visibility ratio is meaningless for something docked to the
 * viewport/ancestor rather than a specific element.

 * before its own click ever arrives. A capture-phase listener on document
 * fires for every click regardless of what any bubble-phase handler does
 * downstream, so no fallback timer is needed.
 *
 * `hide` is the caller's own way to actually hide the backdrop
 * (`hidePopover()` for the via-attribute renderer's top-layer backdrop, a
 * plain `style.display = "none"` for the custom renderer's plain div) —
