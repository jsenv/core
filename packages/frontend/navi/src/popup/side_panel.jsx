/**
 * A drawer docked flush to a viewport (or container) edge — built entirely
 * on top of `Popup` (which itself picks Popover vs Dialog), relying on
 * capabilities those two already have: `layer` + `anchorCustomEventDetail="ignore"`
 * + `positionArea` for the actual docking (Popover natively, Dialog via its
 * own small positionArea subset — see dialog.jsx's top comment), the shared
 * `slide-from-*` animation kind, native Escape handling, and Popover/
 * Dialog's own `onClose` prop (so this component doesn't need to own an
 * openController just to observe a self-initiated close).
 * `anchorCustomEventDetail="ignore"` matters here specifically: without it,
 * Popover would use the triggering button as a real anchor whenever one is
 * available, docking the panel next to *it* instead of flush against the
 * viewport edge — the opposite of what a side panel is for.
 *
 * `animation` only applies when explicitly requested — SidePanel doesn't
 * animate by default.
 *
 * The perpendicular axis (the one *not* along `size`) is always forced to
 * fill its container, but *how* depends on `layer`: with `layer="top"`
 * (default) the container is the viewport itself, so `--navi-vvh`/
 * `--navi-vvw` (kept in sync with `window.visualViewport`, see
 * navi_css_vars.js) are used instead of a plain `100%`/`100dvh` — a plain
 * percentage there would resolve against the top layer's own initial
 * containing block (the *layout* viewport), which doesn't shrink when e.g.
 * the on-screen keyboard opens, unlike the *visible* one. With
 * `layer="local"` the container is a real DOM ancestor, so plain `100%`
 * already tracks it correctly — the popup's own default max-height/
 * max-width ceiling (meant for a centered/dropdown-sized popup) is instead
 * just removed, since that ancestor's own size is already the true limit.

/**
 * @param {object} props
 * @param {boolean} [props.open] - Controlled open state, forwarded as-is to
 *   `Popup`'s own `open`. `isOpen` (legacy alias, still supported) is used
 *   as a fallback when `open` isn't passed.
 * @param {boolean} [props.defaultOpen] - Uncontrolled, mount-only initial
 *   open state, forwarded as-is to `Popup`. Neither this nor `open`/
 *   `isOpen` is required at all for a purely command-driven panel (an `id`
 *   plus a `<Button command="--navi-toggle" commandFor={id}>` elsewhere,
 *   same as `Dialog`/`Popover` themselves — see either's own doc).
 * @param {boolean} [props.isOpen] - Legacy alias for `open` (see above).
 * @param {(event: Event) => void} [props.onClose] - Called when the panel
 *   actually closes (see `Dialog`/`Popover`'s own `onClose`).
 * @param {"left"|"right"|"top"|"bottom"} [props.side="right"] - Which
 *   viewport/container edge the panel is docked flush against.
 * @param {string|number} [props.size] - Size along the docked axis (width
 *   for `left`/`right`, height for `top`/`bottom`) — a bare number is
 *   treated as pixels. Omitted by default: the panel then sizes to its own
 *   content instead of a fixed size (still capped by the popup's own
 *   max-width/max-height, same as `Dialog`/`Popover`). The perpendicular
 *   axis always fills its container regardless (see this file's top
 *   comment for how, and why that differs by `layer`).
 * @param {string|number} [props.minSize] - Floor for the docked axis (same
 *   unit rules as `size`) — forwarded as `Popup`'s own `minWidth`/
 *   `minHeight` (whichever matches the docked axis), so a content-sized
 *   panel (no `size` given) never shrinks below this.
 * @param {"top"|"local"} [props.layer="top"] - `"top"` (default): docks
 *   against the viewport (real top-layer rendering, matches a fixed,
 *   always-on-screen drawer). `"local"`: docks against the panel's own
 *   positioned DOM ancestor instead, confined to (and clipped by) it — for
 *   a drawer that only takes over part of the page rather than the whole
 *   viewport.
 * @param {boolean|"auto"|`slide-from-${string}`} [props.animation] - Off by
 *   default (unlike `Dialog`/`Popover` themselves) — SidePanel is commonly
 *   toggled instead of opened/closed as a one-off, where a slide transition
 *   is more often undesired noise than not. Pass `true`/`"auto"` (resolves
 *   to `slide-from-${side}`) or an explicit direction to opt in.
 * @param {boolean} [props.closeOnClickOutside=false] - `false` (default):
 *   maps to `pointerInteractionOutsideEffect="none"` — in popover mode, no
 *   backdrop at all, outside clicks pass straight through; in dialog mode,
 *   the outside click is still absorbed (a `<dialog>` always blocks
 *   interaction with the rest of the page one way or another — see
 *   `dialog.jsx`'s own doc) but with no dimming effect. `true`: closes the
 *   panel on an outside click instead, and also enables trapping Tab
 *   navigation inside the panel (`focusCapture`) — closing on outside
 *   interaction only makes sense paired with not letting focus silently
 *   leave the panel first.
 * @param {boolean} [props.hideCloseButton=false] - Omits the built-in ×
 *   button in the panel's own top-right corner.
 * @param {"dialog"|"popover"} [props.mode] - Forwarded to `Popup` — forces
 *   one underlying renderer instead of its automatic screen-size
 *   resolution. Note that if `Popup` ends up in dialog mode (small screen,
 *   or forced here), the panel becomes modal regardless of
 *   `closeOnClickOutside`/`pointerInteractionOutsideEffect`: a `<dialog>`
 *   always blocks interaction with the rest of the page one way or another
 *   (see `dialog.jsx`'s own doc) — there is no dialog-mode equivalent of a
 *   popover's fully passive, click-through backdrop.
 * @param {object} [props.style] - Merged with (and overridden by) this
 *   component's own sizing/border-radius styles below.
 * @param {import("preact").ComponentChildren} props.children
