- Drag to move row and column

  (ideally we keep an empty "clone" in the table and we create a visually identic clone to drag)

- Can use shortcuts on table selection
  - cmd + delete would delete rows/columns
    on cells it does nothing but we'll be able to copy via keyboard to start

- Fixed first column and first row (overflow on the rest + it's fixed when there is a lof of content)

- Can delete a table row

- Can update a table row cell

- Can see table columns attributes

- Can update table column attributes

- Can remove table column

- Can move table column

- Pagination

- import.meta.css during build should use stylesheet to inject so that it puts an url instead of constructed stylesheet?
