/**
 * Navi uses three categories of custom events:
 *
 * 1. **Internal events** (`dispatchInternalCustomEvent`) — a component communicates
 *    with other navi components internally. Not meant to be observed from outside.
 *    They do not bubble so they stay contained within the subtree that handles them.
 *    Names often reflect their internal nature (e.g. `navi_pseudo_state_request_check`).
 *
 * 2. **Public events** (`dispatchPublicCustomEvent`) — a component exposes information
 *    about something that happened (e.g. `navi_list_select`). They bubble so any
 *    ancestor can observe them. These are part of the public API and should be documented.
 *
 * 3. **Request events** (`dispatchCustomEvent`) — code *outside* a component asks it
 *    to perform an action (e.g. `navi_list_request_open`). They are cancelable so the
 *    component can signal whether it handled the request. Names are prefixed
 *    with `request_` by convention.
 */
