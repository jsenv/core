When starting an http server there is two distinct things
that code may want to do:

1. Abort the server while it's starting
2. Stop server onces its started

This can be achieved with the following code where
server is aborted if it takes more than 1s to start
and immediatly stopped once started

const abortController = new AbortController()
setTimeout(() => { abortController.abort() }, 1000)
const server = await startServer({
abortSignal: abortController.signal
})
await server.stop()

In order to implement this kind of API two helpers are exported
here:

1. "Abort" which can be used to throw an abort error
   while server is starting
2. "Cleanup" which can be used to track how to cleanup all the things
   done to start the server

Same concepts could be reused when spwaning a child process, a worker, etc..
