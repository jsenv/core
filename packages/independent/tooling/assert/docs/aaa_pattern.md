# The AAA pattern

It is recommended to use the AAA pattern in your test files. "AAA" stands for Arrange, Act, Assert.
You are certainly already using AAA without noticing but it's still good to be aware of the concept.

This pattern is referenced in Node.js best practices:

> Structure your tests with 3 well-separated sections: Arrange, Act & Assert (AAA).
>
