/**

This test is meant to work like this:

It reads the html files generated by ./generate-internal-error-html-files.js
and ensure regenerating them gives the same output.
The goal is to force dev to regenerate the html files and ensure they looks correct
with a human eye verification before commiting anything that would change them.

-> This is snapshot testing to force a human review when internal error html is modified.
