# This workflow is responsible to perform various checks related to the codebase,
# For every push to main or on a pull request, it
# - ensures there is no eslint error on files
# - ensures there is no test failing
# - uploads code coverage from tests to codecov
#
# If all these steps are passing and there is a secrets.NPM_TOKEN and version in package.json
# is not already published, workflow published the package on npm.
