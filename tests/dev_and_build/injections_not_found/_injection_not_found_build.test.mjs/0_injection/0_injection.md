placeholder "__DEMO__" not found in base/client/main.html.
--- suggestion a ---
Add "__DEMO__" in that file.
--- suggestion b ---
Fix eventual typo in "__DEMO__"?
--- suggestion c ---
Mark injection as optional using INJECTIONS.optional():
import { INJECTIONS } from "@jsenv/core";

return {
  "__DEMO__": INJECTIONS.optional("foo"),
};
```
