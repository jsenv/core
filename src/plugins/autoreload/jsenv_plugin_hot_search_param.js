/*
 * When client wants to hot reload, it wants to be sure it can reach the server
 * and bypass any cache. This is done thanks to "hot" search param
 * being injected by the client: file.js?hot=Date.now()
 * When it happens server must:
 * 1. Consider it's a regular request to "file.js" and not a variation
 * of it (not like file.js?as_js_classic that creates a separate urlInfo)
 * -> This is done by redirectReference deleting the search param.
 *
 * 2. Inject ?hot= into all urls referenced by this one
 * -> This is done by transformReferenceSearchParams
