Jsenv is a suite of tools that can be used in projects involving JavaScript.

THe goal of `@jsenv/core` is to provide the following tools:

1. **dev server**; A server that serves source files, facilitating development with live reloading.
2. **build**; Optimizes source files into a specified directory for production.
3. **build server**; Serves the built files, allowing for testing and verifying the production build.
4. **test runner**; Runs test files concurrently, ensuring code reliability.

It favors standards and simplicity.  
This makes jsenv suitable for individuals with limited experience in tooling or those seeking straightforward tools without hidden complexities.

If you want to try jsenv on your machine, use [@jsenv/cli](./packages/related/cli/#jsenvcli).

# The best parts

- **Test files are executed like standard files**.
- **Isolated environment for each test file**: Ensures tests run independently, preventing side effects.
- **Execute tests in multiple browsers**: Supports Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.
- **Extensive browser support during dev**: Allows the use of various browsers beyond the latest Chrome, which is useful for reproducing browser-specific bugs.
- **Large browser support after build**: Ensures compatibility with older versions of Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.
- **Single set of files after build**: Simplifies support and deployement with a unified set of files.
- **Robust versioning during build**: No <a href="https://bundlers.tooling.report/hashing/avoid-cascade/" target="_blank">cascading hash changes</a><sup>â†—</sup>.
- **Advanced support of top level await**.
- **Advanced support of web workers including worker type module**.
- **Ability to load js module using classic script**: See [asJsClassic plugin](./docs/users/g_plugins/g_plugins.md#22-asjsclassic>).
